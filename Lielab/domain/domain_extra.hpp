 * The domain namespace. Houses all functions and classes related to domains available in lielab.
 * 
 * The naming convention used within the domain namespace is different than the standard naming
 * convention used elsewhere. Typically, classes are in PascalCase and functions are in lowercase.
 * Somewhat deviating from this standard, lie algebras are in lowercase and Lie Groups are in
 * UpperCase. This distinction is made to follow mathematical convections. For example, 
 * su is the special unitary lie algebra and SU is the associated Special Unitary group.
